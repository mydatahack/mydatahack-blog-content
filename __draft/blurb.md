Intro:

HELLO WORLD
Welcome to MyDatahack!

My passion is Programming, Data Engineering, Data Science, Mathematics, Database, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence, IT Infrastructure and Architecture. I consider myself as a full-stack data specialist with skills and experience in infrastructure design and setup, data integration, DWH and BI development, DBA, big data engineering and data science application development and deployment. My favourite tools are Java, Python, R, Spark, Node.js, JavaScript, DataStage, Informatica, Talend, AWS, Linux, and all the relational and non-relational databases.

I love writing about things that I think are cool. MyDatahack is a collection of what are cool to me. I also love sharing my knowledge and helping others. There are many practical examples of code/solutions that work. If any of my posts helps you to solve your problem, I am super happy.
