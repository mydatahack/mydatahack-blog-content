## Difference between reset and revert

Git reset and revert are similar, but understanding the difference is important. They can both roll back the change you made. The differnce is that 
reset moves the pointer back to the commit you specify, while revert creates another commit at the end of the chain to cancel the change.

The best way of understanding is to try them out and check log.

When you have to commits and you want to revert the latest commit by 

> git revert f8158531bcb230763086e0d62d8d3748b52cffdb

This will create a new commit at the end of the chain.

When you do reset, the change become unstaged. If you want to revert the reset you just did, you can simply git add & commit.
