# Data Provider Pattern with Jest

Jest has the <span class="code">for</span> method that enables us to do a data provider pattern. <span class="code">for</span> works on both <span class="code">describe</span> and <span class="code">it</span>. It is better to use it in <span class="code">describe</span> so that the assertion messages in <span class="code">it</span> can be dynamically generated.
