# Fixing it.only type error in Jest

If you are getting a type error with it.only in Jest, it could be due to incorrect TypeScript typings or incompatible versions of Jest and TypeScript.
<br /><br />
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
<br /><br />
Make sure you have the latest versions of Jest and its TypeScript typings installed in your project.
<br /><br />

<pre>
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest
Verify that your tsconfig.json file includes the necessary TypeScript configuration for Jest. It should have the following settings:
</pre>

<br /><br />

<pre>
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["jest"]
  }
}
</pre>

<br /><br />
Ensure that your test file has the correct import statement for it.only:
<br /><br />

<pre>
import { it } from '@jest/globals';
</pre>

<br /><br />
This import is necessary when using TypeScript with Jest to avoid type errors.
<br /><br />
