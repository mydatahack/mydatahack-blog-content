# Understanding the difference between the ?? (nullish coalescing) operator and the || (logical OR) operator in JavaScript

<strong>Introduction:</strong><br /><br />
In JavaScript, there are multiple ways to handle default or fallback values when working with variables or expressions. Two commonly used operators for this purpose are the <span class="code">??</span> (nullish coalescing) operator and the <span class="code">||</span> (logical OR) operator. Although they may seem similar at first glance, there are key differences between these operators. This blog post aims to explore and clarify the distinctions between the <span class="code">??</span> operator and the <span class="code">||</span> operator, including their handling of falsy values.<br /><br />

<strong>1. The <span class="code">??</span> Operator:</strong><br /><br />
The <span class="code">??</span> operator, introduced in ECMAScript 2020, is known as the nullish coalescing operator. It provides a concise way to assign a fallback value when the given expression evaluates to <span class="code">null</span> or <span class="code">undefined</span>. Here are some important points to understand about the <span class="code">??</span> operator:

<ul>
  <li>It checks for nullish values specifically (<span class="code">null</span> or <span class="code">undefined</span>), unlike the <span class="code">||</span> operator which considers falsy values (<span class="code">false</span>, <span class="code">0</span>, empty strings, etc.) as well.</li>
  <li>It evaluates the expression on its left-hand side and returns it if it is not nullish; otherwise, it returns the value on the right-hand side.</li>
  <li>Example usage: <span class="code">const result = a ?? b;</span></li>
</ul>

<strong>2. The <span class="code">||</span> Operator:</strong><br /><br />
The <span class="code">||</span> operator, also known as the logical OR operator, has been present in JavaScript for a long time. While it can be used for default value assignment, its behavior is slightly different from the <span class="code">??</span> operator:

<ul>
  <li>It checks for falsy values (<span class="code">false</span>, <span class="code">0</span>, empty strings, etc.) in addition to <span class="code">null</span> and <span class="code">undefined</span>.</li>
  <li>It evaluates the expression on its left-hand side and returns it if it is truthy; otherwise, it returns the value on the right-hand side.</li>
  <li>Example usage: <span class="code">const result = a || b;</span></li>
</ul>

<strong>3. Falsy Values and Use Cases:</strong><br /><br />
Understanding falsy values is crucial for utilizing the <span class="code">??</span> operator and the <span class="code">||</span> operator effectively:

<ul>
  <li>Falsy values in JavaScript include <span class="code">false</span>, <span class="code">0</span>, <span class="code">null</span>, <span class="code">undefined</span>, <span class="code">NaN</span>, and an empty string (<span class="code">""</span>).</li>
  <li>The <span class="code">??</span> operator is useful when you specifically want to handle nullish values (<span class="code">null</span> or <span class="code">undefined</span>) and ignore other falsy values.</li>
  <li>The <span class="code">||</span> operator is more inclusive and handles both nullish values and falsy values.</li>
  <li>Be cautious when using the <span class="code">||</span> operator, as it might unintentionally return a fallback value for values like <span class="code">0</span> or an empty string, which could lead to unexpected behavior.</li>
</ul><br /><br />

<strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /><br />
By understanding the difference between the <span class="code">??</span> operator and the <span class="code">||</span> operator, including their handling of falsy values, you can choose the appropriate operator for your specific use case and avoid unexpected results in your code. The <span class="code">??</span> operator is useful when you want to handle nullish values specifically, while the <span class="code">||</span> operator handles both nullish and falsy values. Remember to consider the compatibility of these operators with different JavaScript versions or environments. By leveraging the <span class="code">??</span> and <span class="code">||</span> operators effectively, you can write more concise and robust code, handling default values in a way that aligns with your specific requirements while considering falsy values in JavaScript.<br /><br />

<strong>Remember:</strong> It's important to check the browser compatibility before using new language features.<br /><br />
