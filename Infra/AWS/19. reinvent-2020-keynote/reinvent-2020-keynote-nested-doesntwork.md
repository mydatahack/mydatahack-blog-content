AWS re:Invent is always exciting and inspiring. Because of the pandemic, this year's re:Invent is 100% online. I watched the keynote speech and took a memo. There is no mind-blowing new services this year (like the equivalent of announcing Lambda or SageMaker). It feels like they are building more capability on the existing services, focusing on IoT, storage, microservices, ML and AI technologies.

<strong>Main takeaways</strong>

<ul>
 	<li>New container and serverless technology announcements.</li>
 	<li>Database technologies and analytics.</li>
 	<li>New IoT services.</li>
 	<li>Lighter on ML/AI technologies than previous few years.</li>
 	<li>AWS is really getting into real engineering and IoT services - product developments, material production, supply chain management etc.</li>
 	<li>Bagging Oracle and Microsoft continues when it comes to databases.</li>
 	<li>Heaps of updates on an existing services.</li>
 	<li>Improvement on Amazon Connect.</li>
</ul>

# Notes taken during speech

# AWS re:Invent 2020

## 1. Keynote Andy Jassy

## Some updates

Amazon CodeGru


### Database and analytics services

Data stores are being reinvented.

- Cloud database: Aroura
Still bagging oracle and microsoftðŸ˜€ Bablefish is the middle finger to SQL server.

Amazon DynameDB (key value)
Amazon ElastiCache (in-memory)
Amazon Neptune (graph)
Amazon DocumentDB with mongodb compatibility (document)
Amazon Timestream (time-series)
Amazon QLDB (ledger)
Keyspaces for Apache Cassandra (wide column)

Amazon Athena
Amazon EMR
Amazon Kinesis
Amazon Elasticsearch Service
Amazon Redshift

- Getting away from talking about ML and AI. In the past few years, keynotes speech had a huge chunk about ML, but this year light-weight
- AWS is optimised for all frameworks
- Pytorch is getting more popular than tensorflow.

SageMaker Studio 
- SageMaker notebooks
- SageMaker Debugger
- SageMaker Experiments
- SageMaker Model Monitor
- SageMaker Autopilot

## Cool things

Boom - high performance aircraft

- Establised by Blake Scholl who was an engineer with amazon. As he started working at amazon after graduated uni, he started flight lessons. At the time, Amazon was building AWS.
- Supersonic airliner, twice as fast. Tokyo to Seattle 4:30h, New York to London 3:30h
- Partner with Japan Airline Rolls Royce, US defence force
- All-in with AWS
- Design and test plane on cloud - used AWS services to simulate flight patterns. AWS enables smaller companies to design plane better. Using AI/ML to improve simulations. Can run simulation in parallel.
- 100% carbon neutral.
- Fastest and affordable. Making supersonic travel affordable.

Carrie
Supply chain company for perishable food and pharma products.

- Because cool chain is hard to maintain, 1/3 of food gets wasted. $1T worth, 1 in 9 people go to bed hungry.
- $35 billion lost for biopharma.
