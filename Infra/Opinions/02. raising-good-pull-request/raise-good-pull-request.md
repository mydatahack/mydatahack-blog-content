# How to Raise Good Pull Request

Throughout my career as a software engineer, I have raised many pull requests. I have raised good ones as well as bad ones. Raising a good pull request is as important as being able to code. Raising a bad pull requests wastes everyone's time and distract team from what is important, delivering quality code. I made so many mistakes and learned a lot of lessons. I decided to write a blog post to distill some of the wisdom on raising a good pull requests. I hope this helps you.
